A dock widget provides a time slider and a configuration dialog for your layers to manage.\r\n\r\n## What Time Manager currently does \r\n\r\nTime Manager filters your vector datasets (It only works for vector data!) and displays only features with timestamps in the user specified time frame. Timestamps have to be in one of the following formats:\r\n\r\n * YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\r\n * YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\r\n * YYYY-MM-DD\r\n\r\nTime Manager plugin requires QGIS >= 1.6.\r\n\r\nThe biggest tested dataset was a Spatialite table with indexed timestamps containing approximately 400,000 points, covering a time span of 24 hours. Stepping through the data for example in 1-hour-sized steps works without problems.\r\n\r\nTime Manager 0.3 supports exporting image series based on the defined animation settings. Our goal for future versions is to include a tool that creates actual animations from these image series. Until then, external programs can be used for this last step. A good option is memcoder. This is how it's used to create an .avi from all images within a folder: \r\n\r\n``mencoder \"mf://*.PNG\" -mf fps=10 -o output.avi -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4``\r\n\r\n## What are the limitations?\r\n\r\nThe plug-in uses Python's  datetime module for calculations. It is therefore limited to the module's functionality. This enfolds (not exhaustive): \r\n\r\n* Dates must accord to the Gregorian calendar \r\n* The range of manageable years is limited due to limitations in time.mktime. The exact range is platform dependent. \r\n* Limits to the size/resolution of the time frame size \r\n\r\nWe currently don't support: \r\n\r\n* Leap years \r\n* Dates with time zone notion \r\n\r\nPlease consider to review the tickets for more information! \r\n\r\n### Other limitations\r\n\r\nShapefiles can't be edited directly, while time-managed. This is an OGR limitation. It also exists for any other query you set: You simply can't edit a shapefile whilst a query is set.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to time-manage Delimited Text layers. This is a limitation of the data provider. Save the data as e.g. Shapefile to use it with Time Manager.\r\n\r\n## Where to download Time Manager\r\n\r\nTime Manager is available through QGIS Plugin Repository http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/timemanager/","name":"Timemanager","google":""}
